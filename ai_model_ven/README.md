    ## Project Setup Guide

    ### Prerequisites
    - Python installed (version X.X or above)
    - pip package manager installed

    ### Installation of Required Python Libraries
    Ensure you have navigated to your project directory before proceeding with the following steps.

    1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
       ```bash
       python -m venv env
       source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
       ```

    2. **Install required Python libraries**:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

       The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following dependencies:
       ```
       library1
       library2
       ```

       Replace `library1`, `library2`, etc. with the actual names of the libraries required for your project.

## API Setup (Securely)

### Mac/Linux

1. **Open Terminal:**
   - Use Terminal on Mac (found in Applications/Utilities) or your preferred terminal emulator on Linux (e.g., GNOME Terminal, Konsole).

2. **Edit ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile:**
   - Open your terminal and edit the Bash configuration file:
     ```
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
     or
     ```
     nano ~/.bash_profile
     ```
   - Add the following line at the end of the file:
     ```
     export AI_NAME_API_KEY="your_AI_NAME_API_KEY_here"
     ```
   - Replace `"your_AI_NAME_API_KEY_here"` with your actual AI_NAME_API_KEY.

3. **Save and Apply Changes:**
   - Exit nano by pressing `Ctrl + X`, confirm changes with `Y`, and save by pressing `Enter`.
   - Apply the changes immediately by running:
     ```
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```
     or
     ```
     source ~/.bash_profile
     ```

4. **Verify:**
   - To verify if the key was correctly set, echo the variable:
     ```
     echo $AI_NAME_API_KEY
     ```
   - It should display your API key.

### Windows

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Search for "Command Prompt" in the Start Menu and open it.

2. **Set Environment Variable:**
   - Set the environment variable using the following command:
     ```
     setx LLAMA_API_KEY "your_AI_NAME_API_KEY_here"
     ```
   - Replace `"your_AI_NAME_API_KEY_here"` with your actual AI API key.

3. **Verify:**
   - To verify if the key was correctly set, echo the variable:
     ```
     echo %AI_NAME_API_KEY%
     ```
   - It should display your API key.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you have successfully configured your API key in environment variables, ensuring secure storage and accessibility for your applications. Remember to treat your API key as confidential and avoid exposing it in public repositories or untrusted environments.


### Example: Generating Text
```python
# Example Python code to generate text using the model
from llama import Llama
import os
import logging
import sys

# Accessing the API key
api_key = os.getenv('LLAMA_API_KEY')

if api_key is None:
    logging.error("API_KEY environment variable not set")
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit the program if API_KEY is not set

# Create an instance of LlamaAPI with the question
api_client = Llama("What is the weather today?")

# Execute the API request
api_client.execute_request()

```
